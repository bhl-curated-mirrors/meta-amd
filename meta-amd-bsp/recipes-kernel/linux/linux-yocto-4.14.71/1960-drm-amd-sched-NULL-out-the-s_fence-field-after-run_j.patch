Subject: [PATCH 1960/4131] drm/amd/sched: NULL out the s_fence field after
 run_job
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

amd_sched_process_job drops the fence reference, so NULL out the s_fence
field before adding it as a callback to guard against accidentally using
s_fence after it may have be freed.

v2: add a clarifying comment
