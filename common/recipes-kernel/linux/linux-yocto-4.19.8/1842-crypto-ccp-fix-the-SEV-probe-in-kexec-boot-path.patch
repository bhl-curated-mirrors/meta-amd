Subject: [PATCH 1842/2940] crypto: ccp - fix the SEV probe in kexec boot path

A kexec reboot may leave the firmware in INIT or WORKING state.
Currently, we issue PLATFORM_INIT command during the probe without
checking the current state. The PLATFORM_INIT command fails if the
FW is already in INIT state. Lets check the current state, if FW
is not in UNINIT state then transition it to UNINIT before
initializing or upgrading the FW.
