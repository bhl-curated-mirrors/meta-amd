Subject: [PATCH 4690/5725] drm/amd/display: Fix BUG_ON during CRTC atomic
 check update
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

For cases where the CRTC is inactive (DPMS off), where a modeset is not
required, yet the CRTC is still in the atomic state, we should not
attempt to update anything on it.

Previously, we were relying on the modereset_required() helper to check
the above condition. However, the function returns false immediately if
a modeset is not required, ignoring the CRTC's enable/active state
flags. The correct way to filter is by looking at these flags instead.

Fixes: e277adc5a06c "drm/amd/display: Hookup color management functions"
Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/106194
