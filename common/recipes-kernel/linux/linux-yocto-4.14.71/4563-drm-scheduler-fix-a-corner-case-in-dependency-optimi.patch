Subject: [PATCH 4563/5725] drm/scheduler: fix a corner case in dependency
 optimization
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When checking for a dependency fence for belonging to the same entity
compare it with scheduled as well finished fence. Earlier we were only
comparing it with the scheduled fence.
